## External Entities and Data Flows

### 1. Librarian (System Administrator)
**Role**: Primary system operator with full administrative privileges
**Data Flows In**:
- Login credentials
- Book information (title, author, year, price, copies)
- Member information (name, email, phone)
- Transaction requests (issue/return books)
- Report generation requests
- System administration commands

**Data Flows Out**:
- Authentication status
- Book catalog and availability
- Member profiles and status
- Transaction confirmations
- Generated reports (analytics, financial, trends)
- System status and notifications

### 2. Library Members
**Role**: End users who borrow books from the library
**Data Flows In**:
- Personal information for registration
